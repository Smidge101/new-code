# new-code
Hello! This is my first ever coding project, This here is a c++ TIc Tac Toe. I used Ravikiran AS tutorial for the tic tac toe.  Link : https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/cpp-tutorial/game-in-cpp

For function 3 in the tutorial I kept getting an error regarding Draws in the game, so I made the return statement for the function true and tie true. So yea if your having trouble with draws in the game just check your return statement for function 3.
